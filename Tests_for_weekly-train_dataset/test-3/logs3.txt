Inferred time series frequency: 'W-THU'
Provided train_data has 366912 rows, 359 time series. Median time series length is 934 (min=80, max=2597). 
	Removing 65 short time series from train_data. Only series with length >= 103 will be used for training.
	After removing short series, train_data has 361712 rows, 294 time series. Median time series length is 1044 (min=247, max=2597). 

Provided dataset contains following columns:
	target:           'target'

AutoGluon will gauge predictive performance using evaluation metric: 'MSE'
	This metric's sign has been flipped to adhere to being higher_is_better. The metric score can be multiplied by -1 to get the metric value.
