Beginning AutoGluon training... Time limit = 1800s
AutoGluon will save models to 'AutogluonModels\ag-20240423_124750'
=================== System Info ===================
AutoGluon Version:  1.0.0
Python Version:     3.10.13
Operating System:   Windows
Platform Machine:   AMD64
Platform Version:   10.0.19045
CPU Count:          4
GPU Count:          0
Memory Avail:       0.74 GB / 5.92 GB (12.6%)
Disk Space Avail:   5.04 GB / 118.01 GB (4.3%)
	WARNING: Available disk space is low and there is a risk that AutoGluon will run out of disk during fit, causing an exception. 
	We recommend a minimum available disk space of 10 GB, and large datasets may require more.

Inferred time series frequency: 'H'
Provided train_data has 353500 rows, 414 time series. Median time series length is 960 (min=700, max=960). 

Provided dataset contains following columns:
	target:           'target'

AutoGluon will gauge predictive performance using evaluation metric: 'RMSE'
	This metric's sign has been flipped to adhere to being higher_is_better. The metric score can be multiplied by -1 to get the metric value.
