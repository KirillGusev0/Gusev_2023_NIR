Beginning AutoGluon training... Time limit = 1800s
AutoGluon will save models to 'AutogluonModels\ag-20240423_093217'
=================== System Info ===================
AutoGluon Version:  1.0.0
Python Version:     3.10.13
Operating System:   Windows
Platform Machine:   AMD64
Platform Version:   10.0.19045
CPU Count:          4
GPU Count:          0
Memory Avail:       1.22 GB / 5.92 GB (20.6%)
Disk Space Avail:   9.58 GB / 118.01 GB (8.1%)
	WARNING: Available disk space is low and there is a risk that AutoGluon will run out of disk during fit, causing an exception. 
	We recommend a minimum available disk space of 10 GB, and large datasets may require more.
===================================================
Setting presets to: medium_quality

Fitting with arguments:
{'enable_ensemble': False,
 'eval_metric': SQL,
 'hyperparameters': 'light',
 'known_covariates_names': [],
 'num_val_windows': 3,
 'prediction_length': 48,
 'quantile_levels': [0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.5, 0.6, 0.7, 0.8, 0.9],

 'refit_full': False,
 'target': 'target',
 'time_limit': 1800,
 'verbosity': 2}

Inferred time series frequency: 'H'
Provided train_data has 353500 rows, 414 time series. Median time series length is 960 (min=700, max=960). 

Provided dataset contains following columns:
	target:           'target'

AutoGluon will gauge predictive performance using evaluation metric: 'SQL'
	This metric's sign has been flipped to adhere to being higher_is_better. The metric score can be multiplied by -1 to get the metric value.
