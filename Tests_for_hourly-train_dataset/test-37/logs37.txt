Inferred time series frequency: 'H'
Provided train_data has 353500 rows, 414 time series. Median time series length is 960 (min=700, max=960). 

Provided dataset contains following columns:
	target:           'target'

AutoGluon will gauge predictive performance using evaluation metric: 'MSE'
	This metric's sign has been flipped to adhere to being higher_is_better. The metric score can be multiplied by -1 to get the metric value.

Starting training. Start time is 2024-04-25 18:53:20
Models that will be trained: ['Theta']
Training timeseries model Theta. Training for up to 3599.6s of the 3599.6s of remaining time.
	-1403735.4354 = Validation score (-MSE)
	134.35  s     = Training runtime
	38.87   s     = Validation (prediction) runtime
Training complete. Models trained: ['Theta']
Total runtime: 173.27 s
Best model: Theta
Best model score: -1403735.4354
Model not specified in predict, will default to the model with the best validation score: Theta
