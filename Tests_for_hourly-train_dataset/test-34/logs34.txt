Inferred time series frequency: 'H'
Provided train_data has 353500 rows, 414 time series. Median time series length is 960 (min=700, max=960). 

Provided dataset contains following columns:
	target:           'target'

AutoGluon will gauge predictive performance using evaluation metric: 'RMSE'
	This metric's sign has been flipped to adhere to being higher_is_better. The metric score can be multiplied by -1 to get the metric value.
