Inferred time series frequency: 'QS-OCT'
Provided train_data has 2214108 rows, 24000 time series. Median time series length is 88 (min=16, max=866). 
	Removing 13678 short time series from train_data. Only series with length >= 97 will be used for training.
	After removing short series, train_data has 1359498 rows, 10322 time series. Median time series length is 118 (min=97, max=866). 

Provided dataset contains following columns:
	target:           'target'

AutoGluon will gauge predictive performance using evaluation metric: 'MAE'
	This metric's sign has been flipped to adhere to being higher_is_better. The metric score can be multiplied by -1 to get the metric value.
