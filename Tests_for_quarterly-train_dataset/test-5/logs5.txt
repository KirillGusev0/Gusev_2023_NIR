Beginning AutoGluon training... Time limit = 3600s
AutoGluon will save models to 'AutogluonModels\ag-20240424_074709'
=================== System Info ===================

Setting presets to: medium_quality

Fitting with arguments:
{'enable_ensemble': False,
 'eval_metric': MSE,
 'hyperparameters': 'light',

 'num_val_windows': 3,
 'prediction_length': 48,
 'quantile_levels': [0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.5, 0.6, 0.7, 0.8, 0.9],

Inferred time series frequency: 'QS-OCT'
Provided train_data has 2214108 rows, 24000 time series. Median time series length is 88 (min=16, max=866). 
Time series in train_data are too short for chosen num_val_windows=3. Reducing num_val_windows to 1.
	Removing 13678 short time series from train_data. Only series with length >= 97 will be used for training.
	After removing short series, train_data has 1359498 rows, 10322 time series. Median time series length is 118 (min=97, max=866). 

Provided dataset contains following columns:
	target:           'target'

AutoGluon will gauge predictive performance using evaluation metric: 'MSE'
	This metric's sign has been flipped to adhere to being higher_is_better. The metric score can be multiplied by -1 to get the metric value.
