Inferred time series frequency: 'MS'
Provided train_data has 10382411 rows, 48000 time series. Median time series length is 202 (min=42, max=2794). 
	Removing 14055 short time series from train_data. Only series with length >= 103 will be used for training.
	After removing short series, train_data has 9354738 rows, 33945 time series. Median time series length is 280 (min=103, max=2794). 

Provided dataset contains following columns:
	target:           'target'

AutoGluon will gauge predictive performance using evaluation metric: 'MSE'
	This metric's sign has been flipped to adhere to being higher_is_better. The metric score can be multiplied by -1 to get the metric value.
