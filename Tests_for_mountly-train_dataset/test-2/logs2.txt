Beginning AutoGluon training... Time limit = 43200s
AutoGluon will save models to 'AutogluonModels\ag-20240430_064253'
=================== System Info ===================
AutoGluon Version:  1.0.0
Python Version:     3.10.13
Operating System:   Windows
Platform Machine:   AMD64
Platform Version:   10.0.19045
CPU Count:          4
GPU Count:          0
Memory Avail:       1.03 GB / 5.92 GB (17.4%)
Disk Space Avail:   7.19 GB / 118.01 GB (6.1%)
	WARNING: Available disk space is low and there is a risk that AutoGluon will run out of disk during fit, causing an exception. 
	We recommend a minimum available disk space of 10 GB, and large datasets may require more.

Inferred time series frequency: 'MS'
Provided train_data has 10382411 rows, 48000 time series. Median time series length is 202 (min=42, max=2794). 
	Removing 14055 short time series from train_data. Only series with length >= 103 will be used for training.
	After removing short series, train_data has 9354738 rows, 33945 time series. Median time series length is 280 (min=103, max=2794). 

Provided dataset contains following columns:
	target:           'target'

AutoGluon will gauge predictive performance using evaluation metric: 'MSE'
	This metric's sign has been flipped to adhere to being higher_is_better. The metric score can be multiplied by -1 to get the metric value.
