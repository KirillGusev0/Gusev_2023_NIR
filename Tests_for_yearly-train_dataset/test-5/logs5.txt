Fitting with arguments:
{'enable_ensemble': False,
 'eval_metric': MSE,

Inferred time series frequency: 'N'
Provided train_data has 720458 rows, 23000 time series. Median time series length is 29 (min=13, max=835). 
Time series in train_data are too short for chosen num_val_windows=4. Reducing num_val_windows to 1.
	Removing 22841 short time series from train_data. Only series with length >= 97 will be used for training.
	After removing short series, train_data has 37773 rows, 159 time series. Median time series length is 207 (min=97, max=835). 

Provided dataset contains following columns:
	target:           'target'

AutoGluon will gauge predictive performance using evaluation metric: 'MSE'
	This metric's sign has been flipped to adhere to being higher_is_better. The metric score can be multiplied by -1 to get the metric value.
