Beginning AutoGluon training... Time limit = 3600s
AutoGluon will save models to 'AutogluonModels\ag-20240429_060949'
=================== System Info ===================
AutoGluon Version:  1.0.0
Python Version:     3.10.13
Operating System:   Windows
Platform Machine:   AMD64
Platform Version:   10.0.19045
CPU Count:          4
GPU Count:          0
Memory Avail:       0.82 GB / 5.92 GB (13.9%)
Disk Space Avail:   9.21 GB / 118.01 GB (7.8%)
	WARNING: Available disk space is low and there is a risk that AutoGluon will run out of disk during fit, causing an exception. 
	We recommend a minimum available disk space of 10 GB, and large datasets may require more.
===================================================
Setting presets to: medium_quality

Fitting with arguments:
{'enable_ensemble': False,
 'eval_metric': MAE,
 'hyperparameters': 'light',
 'known_covariates_names': [],
 'num_val_windows': 4,
 'prediction_length': 48,
 'quantile_levels': [0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.5, 0.6, 0.7, 0.8, 0.9],

 'refit_every_n_windows': 1,
 'refit_full': False,
 'target': 'target',
 'time_limit': 3600,
 'val_step_size': 2,
 'verbosity': 2}

Inferred time series frequency: 'N'
Provided train_data has 720458 rows, 23000 time series. Median time series length is 29 (min=13, max=835). 
Time series in train_data are too short for chosen num_val_windows=4. Reducing num_val_windows to 1.
	Removing 22841 short time series from train_data. Only series with length >= 97 will be used for training.
	After removing short series, train_data has 37773 rows, 159 time series. Median time series length is 207 (min=97, max=835). 

Provided dataset contains following columns:
	target:           'target'

AutoGluon will gauge predictive performance using evaluation metric: 'MAE'
	This metric's sign has been flipped to adhere to being higher_is_better. The metric score can be multiplied by -1 to get the metric value.
