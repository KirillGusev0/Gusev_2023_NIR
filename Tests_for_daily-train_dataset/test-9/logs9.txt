Provided train_data has 9964658 rows, 4227 time series. Median time series length is 2940 (min=93, max=9919). 
	Removing 569 short time series from train_data. Only series with length >= 241 will be used for training.
	After removing short series, train_data has 9855019 rows, 3658 time series. Median time series length is 3445 (min=241, max=9919). 

Provided dataset contains following columns:
	target:           'target'

AutoGluon will gauge predictive performance using evaluation metric: 'MSE'
	This metric's sign has been flipped to adhere to being higher_is_better. The metric score can be multiplied by -1 to get the metric value.
