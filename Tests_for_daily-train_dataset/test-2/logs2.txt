Inferred time series frequency: 'D'
Provided train_data has 9964658 rows, 4227 time series. Median time series length is 2940 (min=93, max=9919). 
	Removing 12 short time series from train_data. Only series with length >= 103 will be used for training.
	After removing short series, train_data has 9963496 rows, 4215 time series. Median time series length is 2941 (min=103, max=9919). 

Provided dataset contains following columns:
	target:           'target'

AutoGluon will gauge predictive performance using evaluation metric: 'MAE'
	This metric's sign has been flipped to adhere to being higher_is_better. The metric score can be multiplied by -1 to get the metric value.
