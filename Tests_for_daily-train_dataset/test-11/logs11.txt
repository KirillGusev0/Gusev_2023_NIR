Beginning AutoGluon training... Time limit = 43200s
AutoGluon will save models to 'AutogluonModels\ag-20240428_195422'
=================== System Info ===================
AutoGluon Version:  1.0.0
Python Version:     3.10.13
Operating System:   Windows
Platform Machine:   AMD64
Platform Version:   10.0.19045
CPU Count:          4
GPU Count:          0
Memory Avail:       1.03 GB / 5.92 GB (17.4%)
Disk Space Avail:   9.36 GB / 118.01 GB (7.9%)
	WARNING: Available disk space is low and there is a risk that AutoGluon will run out of disk during fit, causing an exception. 
	We recommend a minimum available disk space of 10 GB, and large datasets may require more.
===================================================
Setting presets to: medium_quality

Fitting with arguments:
{'enable_ensemble': False,
 'eval_metric': MSE,
 'hyperparameters': {'Theta': {}},
 'known_covariates_names': [],
 'num_val_windows': 4,
 'prediction_length': 48,
 'quantile_levels': [0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.5, 0.6, 0.7, 0.8, 0.9],
 'random_seed': 123,
 'refit_every_n_windows': 1,
 'refit_full': False,
 'target': 'target',
 'time_limit': 43200,

Inferred time series frequency: 'D'
Provided train_data has 9964658 rows, 4227 time series. Median time series length is 2940 (min=93, max=9919). 
	Removing 569 short time series from train_data. Only series with length >= 241 will be used for training.
	After removing short series, train_data has 9855019 rows, 3658 time series. Median time series length is 3445 (min=241, max=9919). 

Provided dataset contains following columns:
	target:           'target'

AutoGluon will gauge predictive performance using evaluation metric: 'MSE'
	This metric's sign has been flipped to adhere to being higher_is_better. The metric score can be multiplied by -1 to get the metric value.

Starting training. Start time is 2024-04-28 22:54:34
Models that will be trained: ['Theta']
Training timeseries model Theta. Training for up to 43186.4s of the 43186.4s of remaining time.
	-503976.5640  = Validation score (-MSE)
	3646.87 s     = Training runtime
	1187.04 s     = Validation (prediction) runtime
Training complete. Models trained: ['Theta']
Total runtime: 4836.31 s
Best model: Theta
Best model score: -503976.5640
Model not specified in predict, will default to the model with the best validation score: Theta
